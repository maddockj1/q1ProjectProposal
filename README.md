# q1ProjectProposal

 *Project Proposal 1*
 
 
* For my q1 project I would like to use the National Park API to provide information on the campsites and average weather to help people plan for trips.  May also integrate a weather API to add in current weather conditions as well.
 
 * The user group would be national park fans.
 
 - I will be using API's and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, DOM manipulation to make it happen.
 
 
 
 *Project Proposal 2*
 
 * The second idea that I have is to create a game of Jeopardy.
 
 * The user of the website would be trivia fans and fans of Jeopardy from around the world.
 
 * I would use a lot of DOM manipulation and the Jeopardy API to integrate and make an interactive online game.  Perferably with a scoring system.
